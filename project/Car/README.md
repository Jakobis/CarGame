# I was Reincarnated as Truck-Kun, and the only Escape is to go on a Rampage to pass on the Curse

A game by Hjalte Dalland, Jakob Israelsen, and Simon Green Kristensen.

## Premise

In true Isekai protagonist fashion, you have been reincarnated as Truck-Kun, and your only
escape from this existence is to kill 100 other people. The police is understably not
thrilled by this idea and will try to stop you, but luckily, the police are people too, and
counts towards you cursed goal. Resist arrest, go on a rampage, and escape the curse of
Truck-Kun.

## Controls

WASD to control the truck. Ram into pedestrians and police to damage them. Your truck will
not take damage when frontally colliding with something.
Press space to restart when the game is over. Press m to mute the game.

For debugging, press the escape key to gain debugging information, and o to spawn more enemies.

## Installation/setup

Assuming you have a setup for Simple Render Engine Project, compiling from source
should be as simple as dragging this folder (`Car`) into the `project` folder,
and adding `add_subdirectory(Car)` to the end of `project/CMakeLists.txt`,
just like the exercises in the course.
