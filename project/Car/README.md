# I was Reincarnated as Truck-Kun, and the only Escape is to go on a Rampage to pass on the Curse
A game by Hjalte Dalland, Jakob Israelsen, and Simon Green Kristensen.
## Premise
In true Isekai protagonist fashion, you have been reincarnated as Truck-Kun, and your only escape from this existence is to kill 100 other people. The police is understably not thrilled by this idea and will try to stop you, but luckily, the police are people too, and counts towards you cursed goal. Resist arrest, go on a rampage, and escape the curse of Truck-Kun.
## Controls
